# Verman CLI: A Technical Deep Dive

## Introduction

- **Purpose of this Document:** To provide a detailed explanation of the internal architecture and logic of `verman-cli`.
- **Target Audience:** Developers contributing to the `verman-cli` project or anyone interested in its underlying mechanics.

## System Architecture

> **High-Level Overview:** A diagram showing the main components (CLI Parser, File Reader, Version Logic, File Writer, Logger) and how they interact.

### Component Breakdown

- **CLI Parser:** Describe the library used (e.g., `yargs`) and how it maps command-line input to internal functions.
- **Core Logic:** Explain the main modules responsible for finding, validating, and updating version strings.
- **File I/O:** Detail how the tool reads from and writes to files, including any safety checks.

## Execution Flow

> **From Command to Output:** A step-by-step walkthrough of a typical command, such as `verman-cli` check [package.json](./package.json).

1. User executes the command in the terminal.
2. The OS runs the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) interpreter on the main script.
3. The CLI Parser processes argv.
4. The check function is invoked with the file path.
5. The File Reader reads [package.json](./package.json).
6. The Version Logic parses the JSON and extracts the version field.
7. The result is formatted and printed to the console.

> **Error Handling:**  How do different components report and handle errors? (e.g., file not found, invalid version format).

## Key Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Version String Parsing:** If the tool supports complex version ranges (e.g., `SemVer`), explain the algorithm used for parsing and comparison.
- **File Traversal:** If the tool can search for version files in a directory, explain the traversal strategy (e.g., recursive search, [.gitignore](./.gitignore) handling).

## Development Guide

- **Setting up the Environment:** Instructions for cloning the repo, installing dependencies (`npm install`).
- **Running Tests:** How to run the unit and integration tests (`npm test`).
- **Code Style and Linting:** Information on the coding standards and how to run the linter (`npm run lint`).
- **Building for Production:** Any build steps required before a new release.

## Future Roadmap

> **Coming soon:** A brief discussion of planned features or potential areas for improvement.
